# Deep Answer

Designing for the present is a senior skill. Over-engineering for a future that never comes is a common trap.

### The "Rule of Three"
Don't abstract until you've duplicated a component at least three times. Until then, you don't truly know what parts are "shared" and what parts are specific.

### Strict API, Flexible Content
A great reusable component has a strict prop API for its variants but allows flexibility in its contents (using `children`).

**Senior Tip**: Accessibility (ARIA, roles, keyboard nav) is not a feature; it's a baseline requirement for any "shared" component.
