# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Senior hone ka matlab sirf complex code likhna nahi hota. Senior hone ka matlab hota hai problems ko pehle samajhna aur simple solutions dena.

Mere liye senior engineer wo hota hai jo:
- Future impact ke baare me soche,
- Team ke liye kaam easy banaye,
- Aur jab cheez break ho, to panic nahi kare.

React sirf ek tool hai — real value decision making aur ownership me hoti hai.
