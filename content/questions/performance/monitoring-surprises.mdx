# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Ek baar release ke baad sab green lag raha tha, par next day monitoring me spike dikha. Specific country ke users ke liye page load time bahut zyada tha.

Root cause nikla CDN configuration issue. Local testing aur staging me sab fine tha, par real traffic me bottleneck aa raha tha. Is incident ne mujhe sikha diya ki performance sirf code ka problem nahi hota, infra bhi utna hi important hai.
