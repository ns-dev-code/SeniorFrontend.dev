# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Senior engineer ke liye performance ek afterthought nahi hoti. Ye design decision ka part hoti hai.

Main pehle se sochta hoon — ye feature performance pe kya impact daalega. Aur agar impact hai, to kya trade-off acceptable hai. Performance optimization ka goal perfect score nahi hota. Goal hota hai real users ke liye smooth experience.
