# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Senior engineer ka kaam sirf Next.js pages banana nahi hota. Senior engineer decides: rendering strategy, caching approach, performance budgets, and integration contracts.

He also thinks about reliability: what happens if API fails, what happens if build breaks, what happens if analytics scripts slow down the page. Aur collaboration bhi: designers ke saath above-the-fold decisions, backend ke saath payload optimization, QA ke saath regression strategy.

Basically senior engineer makes sure system “works in production” — not just “works on localhost.”
