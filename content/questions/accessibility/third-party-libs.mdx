# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Main blindly third-party UI libraries pe trust nahi karta. Main unko audit karta hoon — keyboard flow, ARIA usage, screen reader behavior.

Agar library accessible hai, to great. Agar nahi hai, to ya to wrapper banaata hoon ya alternative suggest karta hoon.

Third-party ka matlab ye nahi hota ki responsibility khatam ho jaaye.
