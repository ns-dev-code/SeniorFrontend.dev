# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Senior engineer ka kaam sirf khud accessible code likhna nahi hota. Senior engineer ka kaam hota hai accessibility ko default banana.

Design system level pe sahi patterns set karna, PR reviews me accessibility issues catch karna, aur team ko educate karna — ye sab senior responsibility hoti hai.

Accessibility koi extra feature nahi hai. Ye product maturity ka signal hai.
