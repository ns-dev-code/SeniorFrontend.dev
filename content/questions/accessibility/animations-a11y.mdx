# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Animations UX improve kar sakti hain, par overuse me problem ban jaati hain. Especially motion-sensitive users ke liye.

Main hamesha prefers-reduced-motion respect karta hoon. Agar user ne reduced motion choose kiya hai, to animations minimal ya disable ho jaati hain.

Subtle transitions fine hain, flashy animations accessibility ke against jaati hain.
