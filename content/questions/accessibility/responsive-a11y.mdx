# Deep Answer

### Interview Answer (Aise bolna hai):
Responsive design me accessibility ka matlab sirf screen size adjust karna nahi hota. Interaction patterns bhi change ho jaate hain.

Mobile pe hover nahi hota, isliye hover-only interactions accessibility break kar dete hain. Touch targets bhi properly sized hone chahiye.

Main hamesha ye ensure karta hoon ki mobile aur desktop dono pe keyboard aur screen reader flow logical ho. Responsive design ka matlab accessible design hi hona chahiye.
